# WebAPI quiz
Advanced Javascript Challenge - creating a quiz


## Description
Using skills learnt, I am aiming to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write.

## Process

This website is to display advanced JavaScript Skills. When the user clicks the "Start" button, they will go through a series of timed questions in which they will lose 10 seconds everytime the get a question wrong, at the end of the game the user will see their score and save this with their initials alongside a leaderboard.

I started off strong with my Questions file, representing each question as an object in an array. I then created a Scores and Logic file which would tie everything together and display the scores.

There is also additional functionality so the user can view the highscore board and clear the scores.

## Additional notes

I used a combination of objects, arrays, functions, for loops, each and if statements as well as learnt how to call and return functions as well as various operators.

The biggest challenge I faced was the Logic page as this was the most detailed one, I got hit by data fatigue and would have got bogged down with uncaught syntax errors due to staring at a page of code too long, there is a large amount of information on the internet which can become overwhelming, therefore I did my commits frequently, stepped away and worked on other sections and then came back. In the end, I got my logic working. 

The only other improvement I would probably include is adjusting the highscore board logic so it would show the scores in descending order so you would get more of a leaderboard.
